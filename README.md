# Paint-Slick2D
An old 1st (2020) year Paint project in an outdated Java library, Slick2D.

It was done using a lot of quick-fixes and exploiting existing bugs. The library Slick2D has been abandoned for many years and its documentation barren. So this project gave me the opportunity to learn to explore a full framework with experimentation and reasoning through reading all the methods and classes.
